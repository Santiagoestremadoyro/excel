# Project: Excel-Python Mastery

This project aims to improve and expand your Excel skills by implementing solutions using Python. As you work on this project, you will strengthen your understanding of data manipulation, analysis, and automation, all integrated with the powerful capabilities of Python.

## Goals

1. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks:**
   - Use Python to automate tedious and repetitive tasks in your Excel spreadsheets.
   - Explore libraries such as `pandas`, `openpyxl` and `xlrd` for efficient data manipulation.

2. **Data Analysis in Excel:**
   - Perform more advanced data analysis using Python to process large data sets directly from Excel.
   - Experiment with visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

3. **Integration with Excel API:**
   - Connect your Excel spreadsheet with external services using APIs and libraries like `pywin32`.

4. **Creation of Dynamic Reports:**
   - Develop dynamic reports that update automatically when underlying data changes.
   - Uses Python to generate dynamic charts and summary tables.

5. **Custom Function Development:**
   - Create custom functions in Python and use them directly in your Excel formulas.
   - Experiment with creating UDF (User Defined Functions) functions.
